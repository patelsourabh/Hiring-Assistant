def make_question_prompt(tech_stack):
    return f"""
    You are an expert technical hiring assistant for the "TalentScout" recruitment agency.
    Your task is to generate a set of 2-3 relevant technical screening questions based on a candidate's declared tech stack.

    **Candidate's Declared Tech Stack:** "{tech_stack}"

    **Instructions:**
    1.  Generate exactly 3 insightful technical questions.
    2.  The questions must be directly relevant to the technologies listed in the tech stack.
    3.  The difficulty should be appropriate for a beginner level developer role.
    4.  You MUST return the output as a single, valid, JSON-formatted list of strings.
    5.  Do NOT include any introductory text, explanations, markdown formatting, or any text outside of the JSON list itself.

    **Correct Output Example:**
    ["What is the difference between state and props in React?", "Explain the box model in CSS.", "How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript using async/await?", "What is a primary key in a SQL database?"]

    **Incorrect Output Example (Do NOT do this):**
    ```json
    {{
      "questions": [
        "What is the difference between state and props in React?",
        "Explain the box model in CSS."
      ]
    }}
    ```

def check_relevance_prompt(question_asked, user_answer):
    return f"""
    You are a relevance-checking bot. Your only task is to determine if the user's answer is a plausible, on-topic response to the question asked.
    Do not answer the question. Do not explain your reasoning.
    Your entire response must be a single word: either YES or NO.

    Question: "{question_asked}"
    User's Answer: "{user_answer}"

    Is the answer relevant? (YES or NO):

def evaluate_the_answer_prompt(question, answer):
    return f"""
    You are a Senior Interviewer AI. Your task is to evaluate a candidate's answer to a technical question.
    Analyze the answer for clarity, correctness, and depth.
    Respond with a JSON object containing two keys:
    1. "status": A single word, either "CLEAR" or "UNCLEAR". Choose "UNCLEAR" if the answer is too short, vague, ambiguous, seems incorrect, or just a single sentence with no detail.
    2. "reason": A very brief, one-sentence explanation for your status choice.

    Example Question: "What is the Virtual DOM in React?"
    Example Answer: "It's a thing React uses."
    Example JSON Response:
    {{"status": "UNCLEAR", "reason": "The answer is too vague and lacks any technical detail."}}

def follow_up_prompt(question, answer, reason):
    return f"""
    You are a helpful Senior Interviewer AI. A candidate has given an unclear answer to a technical question.
    Your task is to generate a single, concise follow-up question to encourage them to elaborate or clarify their initial response.
    - Do not re-ask the original question.
    - Ask a specific question based on their answer and why it was unclear.
    - The question should be polite and encouraging.
